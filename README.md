# SIDE PROJECTS
## Overview
This is a side project I and my friend working on to further understand concepts and to have fun with code - since you can do almost anything you want to do.


## Project Tiers
This project is organized into different tiers from beginner to advanced as we keep on improving. Each tier builds upon the previous one, providing more advanced features and challenges.

## Beginner Tier

**Overview:**
The beginner tier focuses on foundational concepts of programming with basic features and with basic logic.This serves as a test to see if we understand the concepts.
